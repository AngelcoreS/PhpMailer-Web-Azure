            <h3>Dangers in the future</h3>
            <h4>Super PCs, Encryption Vulnerability, Cybersecurity Disruption</h4>
            <p>
                Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity by rendering traditional encryption methods obsolete. Its ability to perform complex calculations exponentially faster
                 than classical computers could break widely-used encryption algorithms, jeopardizing sensitive data. However, quantum-resistant cryptography, such as lattice-based or hash-based encryption,
                  is being developed to counter this threat. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a secure way to exchange cryptographic keys, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to detect any 
                  eavesdropping attempts. Quantum computers could also enhance cybersecurity through improved threat detection and anomaly analysis, empowering organizations to identify and respond to cyber 
                  threats more effectively. In summary, while posing challenges, quantum computing also presents opportunities for advancing cybersecurity defenses.

                <h3>Assambling Personal Computers</h3>
                <h4>CPU, GPU, Motherboard, RAM, Storage, Peripherals</h4>
                <p>

A personal computer relies on various interconnected components to support the software running on it, such as the operating system.
<br><br>
Every computer includes a motherboard, processor, GPU (sometimes the processor has integrated graphics, making a dedicated GPU unnecessary for office use), RAM, storage, power supply, and peripherals.
<br><br>
The choice of components for a computer depends on the type of work it will be used for ^`^twhether it's an office computer, a design workstation, or a high-performance computing machine.
<br><br>
The motherboard serves as the bodywork, connecting all components, while the processor, like a car engine, executes tasks.
<br><br>
The GPU, or graphics processing unit, handles image quality and is crucial for graphics-intensive activities. While some processors include integrated graphics, a dedicated GPU can make
 a significant difference, especially in design and gaming.
<br><br>
RAM, or random access memory, acts as the computer's temporary workspace, storing data for quick access. Storage, whether in traditional hard drives or solid-state drives (SSD),
 permanently saves files and programs.
<br><br>
The power supply is the energy provider, and peripherals, such as the keyboard and mouse, are the interaction tools. By customizing these elements based on the user's needs, one can achieve an
efficient computing experience tailored to specific tasks.

                    Don't forget to link your HTML file with your CSS file. Ensure they are in the same folder, or if they are in different folders, specify the path.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/zaouyyw8g/csspath.png?updatedAt=1725315072565" alt="csspath">
                    <br><br>
                    Another tip to make your website mobile-friendly is to add the following code between the head tags:
                    <br><br>
                    meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1
                    <br><br>
                    Also, add the following code at the end of the CSS file:
                    <br><br>
                    @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
                      /* Add respective changes depending on your website */
                    }
                    <br><br>
                    To preview your changes, right-click on your HTML file, and select "Open with Live Server." Now, you can see the saved changes in real-time.
